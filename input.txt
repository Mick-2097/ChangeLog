1) Can you do it not in a dark mode? Make the classic view.                     Yes

2) You didn't use bootstrap elements.                                           ??

The list of articles should be a card.                                          ok

The groups should be the tabulation with the design of the bootstrap.           ??

On the prototypes squares are pretty much areas, not all elements require
 to have a border on them.                                                      ok

3) For the menu you used row, are you sure it's can be mobile friendly
 on certain resolutions?                                                        
Remember, we're doing it not for ourselves. 
People expect certain look when we present 
a framework and it's a public page                                              ok

1) Remove border-dark from cards.
2) Make the header more narrow
3) Make header background a little darker and get rid of the border bottom
4) For the left menu use vertical navs instead:

5) Make the left menu closer to the content. Margin seems off.
6) For Log1.html make gome page alligned with  the rest of the page
7) Make datetime alligned as well for log1.html
8) Log1.html is missing header and make the date smaller
9) Use a card for an article so
10) YOu don't use any layout wich makes the pages look unfinished. Use this ones:
