1) Can you do it not in a dark mode? Make the classic view.                     Yes

2) You didn't use bootstrap elements.                                           ??

The list of articles should be a card.                                          ok

The groups should be the tabulation with the design of the bootstrap.           ??

On the prototypes squares are pretty much areas, not all elements require
 to have a border on them.                                                      ok

3) For the menu you used row, are you sure it's can be mobile friendly
 on certain resolutions?                                                        
Remember, we're doing it not for ourselves. 
People expect certain look when we present 
a framework and it's a public page                                              ok
