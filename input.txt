1) Can you do it not in a dark mode? Make the classic view.                     Yes

2) You didn't use bootstrap elements.                                           ??

The list of articles should be a card.                                          ok

The groups should be the tabulation with the design of the bootstrap.           ??

On the prototypes squares are pretty much areas, not all elements require
 to have a border on them.                                                      ok

3) For the menu you used row, are you sure it's can be mobile friendly
 on certain resolutions?                                                        
Remember, we're doing it not for ourselves. 
People expect certain look when we present 
a framework and it's a public page                                              ok

1) Remove border-dark from cards.
2) Make the header more narrow
3) Make header background a little darker and get rid of the border bottom
4) For the left menu use vertical navs instead:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navs-tabs/#vertical
5) Make the left menu closer to the content. Margin seems off.


6) For Log1.html make home page alligned with  the rest of the page
7) Make datetime alligned as well for log1.html
8) Log1.html is missing header and make the date smaller
9) Use a card for an article so
10) YOu don't use any layout wich makes the pages look unfinished. Use this ones:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/#default-container
11) Check out the examples and how they built a page:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/

12) For the header le'ts use a navbar:

13) Take a look at the examples and get the structuring ideas from it:

Is missing the headline and also date and time should not be this big.
THe header in the right upper corner, but it should be the place for the horizontal navigation and the header should be in the center of the page. h1

The general points:

x1) Remember, bootstrap has a solution for everything. In this part of work you definitely missed forms and they are styled weird. Too black lines, strange paddings etc. Take a look at bootstrap forms

x2) Some of your pages content is wrong. E.g. on log1.html you have container which is supposed to contain the entire page content, but instead it has just a menu (link?) and the content is a separate card somewhere else and in order to align you had to repeat twice: w-75 m-auto

x3) Work on footer as well

?4) Attach summernote plugin to the editor input.
Also don't be crazy about sizes. Standard size elements are fine and make pages look more official. Especially for admin panel.

There's a lot to list about forms, but I think you should reapply the strategy for all of them.

x In the admin panel and public pages add nav menu to groups, changelogs and home for public I think
